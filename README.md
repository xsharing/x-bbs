## Caution

This project is very experimental.
There are a lot of issues I'm aware of.
Not for production, not to be public.

## About this Project

This is an BBS for small-medium sized groups.
Architecture decisions are made to experiment relatively new technologies and libraries (as of 2023).

## Dev

### expected environment

- docker running Linux (WSL2 is also fine)
- VS Code with Dev Container

### open projects in VS Code

Open `{frontend, backend, aws}` folders in VS Code separately and run them in Dev Container.
